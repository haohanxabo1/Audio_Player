Hi there ! 
This is fast manual to use the application:

- Click in setting icon, choose the directory (folder) that contains your .mp3 files.
- After selecting the folder, click the Save button and click the Reload button.
- The app will scan that folder and load all the audio files into the list.
- You can then play, pause, and navigate between tracks using the control buttons.
- Make sure the folder you select actually exists and contains valid .mp3 files.
