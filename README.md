This is a simple, fast audio player built with **C#**, **WPF**, and **[NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio)**.  
It’s lightweight, easy to use, and will be updated with more features in the future.

##  Overview
**AudioPlay** is a desktop music player that lets you play and manage your `audio` files easily.  
It features a minimal and intuitive interface — just choose your music folder, reload, and enjoy.

##  How to Use

1. **Open Settings**  
   Click the ⚙️ *Settings* icon and choose the directory (folder) that contains your `audio` files.

2. **Save and Reload**  
   After selecting the folder, click **Save**, then click the **Reload** button on the main window.  
   The app will scan that folder and automatically list all the audio files.

3. **Play Music**  
   - ▶️ **Play**  
   - ⏸ **Pause**  
   - ⏮ / ⏭ **Previous / Next Track**

4. **Volume & Progress**  
   - Use the **slider** to control playback progress.  

5. **Navigation**  
   Use the **Up** and **Down** arrow buttons to move through your playlist.



## ⚠️ Notes
- Ensure the selected folder exists and contains valid **audio files**, such as:  `.mp3, .wav, .aiff, .wma, .aac, .flac, .alac, .ogg`.  
- If nothing appears after reloading, double-check your folder path in **Settings**.
